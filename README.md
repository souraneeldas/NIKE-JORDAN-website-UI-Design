Sure! Here's a technical description you can use for your GitHub repository that outlines the Nike Jordan UI Design using Figmaâ€”highlighting your use of Auto Layout, advanced prototyping, wireframing, and user flow optimization:
Nike Jordan UI Design â€“ Figma Project
Overview
This project showcases a modern, responsive UI design for Nike Jordan sneakers, built entirely using Figma. The design is intended for use in web and mobile interfaces and focuses on clean aesthetics, usability, and high-fidelity interaction.
Tools & Technologies
Figma (Primary Design Tool)
Auto Layout (for responsive design components)
Prototyping (interactive flow & navigation)
Wireframing (initial structure & UX planning)
Components & Variants (reusable design elements)
Design Tokens (consistent color, typography, spacing)
Features1. Auto Layout (Advanced)
Fully implemented Auto Layout for all UI sections (header, product card, buttons, etc.)
Responsive containers that adapt to content size and screen resolution
Nested Auto Layouts for reusable components like product previews and CTA buttons
2. Prototyping & User Flow
Seamless navigation between product selections (e.g., color variants)
Clickable "Add to Bag" and product videos to simulate real user experience
Scroll and transition animations implemented to enhance engagement
Logical flow from browsing â†’ selecting â†’ adding to cart
3. Wireframing
Low-fidelity wireframes created to map out key user journeys before visual design
Focus on UX hierarchy and element prioritization
Iterative feedback loop before final design
4. Design System
Centralized style guide for:
Typography (consistent font sizes and styles)
Color palettes (brand colors and neutral tones)
UI Elements (buttons, icons, input fields)
Organized in Figma assets for quick use and team scalability

ðŸ§  UX Principles Followed
Visual hierarchy: Clear focus on the sneaker with CTA prominence
Consistency: Repeated styles and layout patterns
Accessibility: Adequate contrast and readable font sizes
Microinteractions: Hover states and transitions for realism
